CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in
spirit to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. CxxTest is easy to use because
it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it
employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a
very flexible form of test discovery.

CxxTest is available under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).
